def open_file(file): #open file and read it as bytes, then return the [length of bytes,content in byte] 
def handle_image(bytes_data): #return payload length of this frame to make a decision if there is more data comming
def handle_websocket_header(bytes_data): receive frame and return [bytes data,binary payload_length, binary extend_payload_length]
def create_websocket_format(payload_data, payload_len, extend_payload_len) return a websocket frame

OBJ 1 : when client first connect server will append to client list, use following code to get base64 sha1 then send to client
			accept_response = sec_websocket_key + GUID
                        hash_accept_response = hashlib.sha1(accept_response)
                        base64_accept_response = base64.b64encode(hash_accept_response.digest())
OBJ 2 : 1.when receive frame pass it to handle-websocket to retrive payload_length, extend_payload_length, mask payload data with the mask key
	return masked and escaped data, binary extend_payload_length with format 07b, and extend payload length 016b or 064b
	2.use return value from step 1 to construct frame in create_websocket_format to return a sending frame

OBJ 3 use mongo. store {payload_data,length,extend_length} after value return from handle_websocket_header
      when client connect to server send everything in the db

OBJ 4 construct docker compose, direct copy from lecture

OBJ 5 send image data from js as text of dataurl, so it will follow same instruction as OBJ 2
	1. some image can take more than 15 sec for processing
	2. my code can not process an image frame when it contain start header of 111111110000000000000000000000
	3. if sending image after a image with start header 111111110000000000000000000000 is sned, will require refresh
		everytime when image is send to client because of OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket
	4. I add #mycol.drop() in line 19, if this type of image is sent, will require to empty the database because error may occur when server
	 trying to retrive this image from db
//Add note : any image larger than 100kb will not able to send
